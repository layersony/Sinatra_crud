# Phase 3 Project Guidelines

## Learning Goals

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

Congrats on getting through all the material for Phase 3! Now's the time to put
it all together and build something from scratch to reinforce what you know and
expand your horizons.

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.
